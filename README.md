# HistogramExample
 Experiments with image manipulation in Csharp, potential HAR wavelets.

## Description

I played around with image manipulation around 2010. This app applies some resizing and contrast in combination with reduced bit depth so I could visually review image features. At the time I was thinking about feature detection and how to go about doing that in code. Of course since then the world of computer vision systems has grown and there isn't much I can offer as a dilettante. Still, it's interesting to break an image apart and see what components make them up. I was curious if I would use Haar wavelets for object detection and this was a stab at seeing if that was possible. Obviously I never got to the code for actual object detection. Still, if someone wants a histogram in their own app, maybe this will be helpful.
